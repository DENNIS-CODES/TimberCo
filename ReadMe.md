## OOPII ASSIGNMENT
Obuds2020 is a wood based business which specializes in sourcing and selling different kinds of wood.
Currently their focus is on softwood and hardwood.
The woods are categorized according to the dimensions as :
 A-1X1”,
 B-1X2”,
C-2X2”,
D-2X3”,
E-3X3”,
F-3X4”,
G-4X4”,
H-1X6”,
I-2X6”,
J-3X6”
# The selling price per foot of the
dimension categories, A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H is based on the cost of A according to the rules:
Cost of B=A +30%A,
Cost of C=B +30%B,
Cost of D=C +30%C,
Cost of E=D +30%D,
Cost of F=E+30%E,
Cost of G=F +20%F, 
Cost of H=G +20%G.
 The cost of A may be reset from time to time if it becomes necessary.
The selling price per foot for J and that of I are related by Cost of J=I +50%I. The cost for I may be
reset from time to time if it becomes necessary.
At all times the selling price per foot is 100% of the purchase price per foot from the supplier.
Hardwood is always 200% more costly that softwood at the supplier point and 220% more costly at the
selling point.
## Requirements
# You are required to well commented abstract a class with with relevant data and methods to make it
possible to:
1. Generate a report on sales for each category of wood.
2. Generate a report on stock at any one period of time.
3. Generate a report on profit earned by a sale for each category of wood.
4. Generate a report on total profit made.
5. Draw a UML diagram of the abstract class
## Write well commented program ( main calss) that make use of the above class and also use the
following programming construct:
• Paramerised constructor
• A method that receives an object and then process the profit made
• Use of Math.random() method to generate lengths of feet sold
• A method that receives an array of objects and then process the sales made
• A method that creates an array of objects sold and return the array
## Deliverable
1. A pdf document that contains the entire program and the UML diagram and the output results
